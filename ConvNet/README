## 1. Introduction
- What is your MSE/MAE with linreg vs tuned network? 
	MSE/MAE of my tuned network reduced from 19.88 MSE using 15 neurons, to 14.06 MSE, respectively. After widening the model and adding on hidden layer with size 30, I was able to train with 15 neurons to provide this result.

    Adding 5 layers with 128 neurons increased my MSE to 38.67. 


## 2 Intro to convolution operations: padding
		
- What is a response layer? (Give a brief, 1-sentence description)
    A response layer, normalizes an input allowing batch processessing of smaller portions of an input. 
- Given the filter shape of (26, 26, 32), what does each number represent?
    The first and second numbers represents the dimensions of the input, usually a picture and the third number preresents the depth. 
- Given 6x6 input and filter of (3,3): what is the response shape that we get? 
    (4,4)
- Given (33, 33, 1) input and filter of (2,2): what is the response shape that we get? 
    (32,32)
- What is the difference between 'valid' and 'same' padding? Given 6x6 input and filter of (3,3), what are the response shapes for both options? 
    Valid pading drops any bits that arent fully encapsulated by a filter. Same padding pads evenly around the border but will add aditional padding if needed. 
    Valid-(4,4)
    Same-(6,6)

## 3 Convolution Parameters: Stride and Pooling
- What is max pooling? (Give a brief, 1-sentence description)
    Max pooling is a downsampling method that takes the largest value in a sample and applies it across the entire sample. 

- If I apply pooling of 2 (2,2 window with a stride of 2) to a (6,6) array, what is the resulting size?
    (3,3)

## 4 ConvNet Architecture
-Define I, O, F, S, P as used in this lecture (Give a brief, 1-sentence description)
    I: Input Volume is the shape of the inputting image or frame
    O: Output Volume is the shape of the normalized frame. O = (I-F+2P)/(S+1)
    F: Filter is the shape of the filter.
    S: Stride is the distance of the steps between windows. 
    P: Padding is the ammount added to the edges of a frame to fully encapsulate it by the filter. 
-What is my output size if Input = (100, 100), kernel size=(2, 2), the stride of 1, and no pooling? 
    (46,46)
-How many weights do I have if I have 24 such filters stacked (conv2_24)?
    (2x2X2)*24=192
-Solve for the padding (P), in terms of I, F, and S, if we want the input and output size to remain the same. 
    P = (F-1)/2

## 5 Practical Patterns
- What can we use the ImageDataGenerator for? What can it help us fight? (Give a brief, 1-sentence description)
    ImageDataGenerator allows us to batch process images into usable tensors. 
- What is a better idea: To use one larger kernel (8,8) or multiple stacked smaller ones, 4x(2,2)? Why? Show the number of weights for each option. 
    Multiple small kernals is preferred to one large. 
    conv1_24 = (8x8x1)*24 = 1536
    conv4_24 = (2x2x4)*24 = 384
